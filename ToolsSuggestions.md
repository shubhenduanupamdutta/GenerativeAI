### JArchitect

It is an AI-powered tool specifically designed for Java applications. It performs static code analysis to identify dependencies between classes, packages, and libraries in a Java project. By visualizing these dependencies in an interactive graph format, JArchitect enables developers to understand the impact of changes on the overall architecture and make informed decisions during refactoring or system evolution.

### ArchR

It is an AI-powered tool that uses pattern recognition techniques to identify architectural patterns in software systems. By analyzing codebases, ArchR can detect common patterns such as layered architecture, client-server architecture, or MVC (Model-View-Controller) patterns. It then generates visual diagrams that highlight these patterns, making it easier for developers to understand the systemâ€™s overall structure.

### NaturalDocs

It can generate comprehensive documentation from comments, variables, and function signatures, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the legacy code.

### Kite

It uses machine learning algorithms to suggest relevant code snippets, function calls, and variable names, enhancing developer productivity while working with legacy code.

### IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z, is a new product that utilizes generative AI to facilitate the translation of COBOL to Java and enhance productivity on the platform
